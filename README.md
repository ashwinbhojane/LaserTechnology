PHP Form with Validation and Success Handling

This PHP script handles form submissions by validating user input (name, organization, contact, email, remark). It checks for required fields, valid phone numbers, and email formats. If there are no validation errors, the form data is processed, and a success message is set in the session before redirecting the user to the same page to prevent resubmission.
